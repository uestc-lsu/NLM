Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm is the best image denoising algorithms for its capability to better keep the imageâ€™s texture details and used widely in Remote Sensing image preprocessing area. However, the time complexity of the algorithm is very high due to its non-locality when searching similar pixels, which cannot satisfy the near real-time requirement in some specific applications. In order to resolve this issue, we designed and implemented a parallel NLM algorithm based on Intel Xeon Phi hardware, which has Intel's Many Integrate Core (MIC) architecture. In order to make full use of the computation resources, a dynamic load balance based collaborative parallel algorithm that can use both MIC and CPU resources is developed.
